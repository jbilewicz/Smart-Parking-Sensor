# Smart-Parking-Sensor
This project is an advanced parking assistance system based on the ESP32 microcontroller. It uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distance with high precision. The data is processed using a custom Exponential Moving Average (EMA) filter to ensure smooth bar animations on the OLED screen.
